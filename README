Community AR9170 Linux firmware
-----------------------

This is the firmware for the Atheros ar9170 802.11n devices.

To build the firmware you will need an SH-2 toolchain.
You can build your own toolchain:

make -C toolchain

but be aware that this will take some time and requires
about 1.2 GiB disk space.

The resulting firmware, carl9170.fw, can be used only
with the carl9170 Linux driver.

After getting a toolchain, simply build:

autogen.sh
